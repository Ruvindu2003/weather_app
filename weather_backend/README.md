## Deployment

When you're ready to deploy your NestJS application to production, there are some key steps you can take to ensure it runs as efficiently as possible. Check out the [deployment documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/deployment) for more information.

If you are looking for a cloud-based platform to deploy your NestJS application, check out [Mau](https://mau.nestjs.com), our official platform for deploying NestJS applications on AWS. Mau makes deployment straightforward and fast, requiring just a few simple steps:

```bash
$ npm install -g @nestjs/mau
$ mau deploy
```

With Mau, you can deploy your application in just a few clicks, allowing you to focus on building features rather than managing infrastructure.

## Weather Analytics (Part 1)

This project includes a Weather Analytics module that:
- Loads city IDs from src/cities.json
- Fetches current weather from OpenWeatherMap
- Computes a Comfort Index (0-100) on the backend
- Caches raw API responses for 5 minutes and processed results for 1 minute
- Exposes HTTP endpoints to retrieve results and cache status

Comfort Index (backend formula)
- Inputs used: temperature, humidity, wind speed, cloudiness
- Subscores (0-100):
  - Temperature: ideal 22°C. tempScore = max(0, 100 - |tempC - 22| * 4)
  - Humidity: ideal 50%. humidityScore = max(0, 100 - |humidity - 50| * 1.5)
  - Wind: ideal 0-3 m/s. windScore = max(0, 100 - max(0, wind-3) * 20)
  - Clouds: ideal ~20%. cloudScore = max(0, 100 - |clouds - 20| * 0.8)
- Aggregate (weighted): score = 0.4*tempScore + 0.3*humidityScore + 0.2*windScore + 0.1*cloudScore
- Score clamped and rounded to integer between 0 and 100.

Why this formula
- Temperature and humidity have strong perceptual impact, so they get highest weights.
- Wind and cloudiness affect perceived comfort but less than temperature/humidity.
- Weights and ideal values are simple and explainable; include any further notes here.

Setup & Running
1. Add OPENWEATHER_API_KEY to the .env file.
2. Ensure AUTH0_AUDIENCE in .env matches the API Identifier configured in Auth0 (this repo sets it to "localhost:7000/").
3. Restart the server: npm run start

Endpoints
- GET /weather — returns list of cities with weather, comfortScore and rank
- GET /weather/cache — returns cache debug information (raw entries and processed cache TTL)
- GET /weather/:id — returns a single city's processed data

Notes
- cities.json currently contains 10 sample city IDs in src/cities.json.
- The backend computes and ranks cities; frontend should only display returned data.
